## Creating an interactive map with Leaflet for USGS data 

Within this challenge I utilized Leaflet, JS, CSS, and HTML to create an interactive map of the world. On this map are high magnitutde earthquakes and their locations. 
- The size of the circular marker is correlated to the magitude of the earthquake experienced \
- While the color of each circular marker is associated with the depth at which the earthquake occured 
- Clicking a circular marker will provide some additional information
- A legend was integrated and included in the bottom right of the map
